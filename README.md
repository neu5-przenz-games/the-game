# Development

To build local development version of a game run
`yarn dev`

To start the server run
`yarn serve`
and you should see page at
`localhost:5000`

The best way to test the production environment locally is to run
`NODE_ENV=production yarn build`
and then to start the server run
`yarn serve`
